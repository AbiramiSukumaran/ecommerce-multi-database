# Polyglot Ecommerce Application

## Run the Application Yourself

To test this multi-modal application, you need to clone the repository and set up your environment variables to connect to the databases you provisioned in Steps 2, 3, and 5.

1. Go to you Cloud Shell Terminal, clone the repo and navigate into the project folder:
git clone https://github.com/AbiramiSukumaran/ecommerce-multi-database.git

cd ecommerce-multi-database

2. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Update the .env file you cloned from the repo with your values:

# --- DATABASE SECRETS ---
# 1. MongoDB Connection String (from MongoDB Atlas)
MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING="mongodb+srv://<db_user>:<db_password>@YOUR_CLUSTER.mongodb.net"

# 2. Google Cloud Storage Bucket Name (from Step 5)
GCS_PRODUCT_BUCKET="your-ecommerce-product-media-bucket"

# 3. MCP Toolbox Server Location
# Must match the address where you run the toolbox server (usually localhost:5000)
MCP_TOOLBOX_SERVER_URL="http://localhost:5000"
4. Update the data layer

Update tools.yaml for placeholder with your values.

Test your tools.yaml tools locally:

./toolbox --tools-file "tools.yaml"

or

./TOOLBOX 
5. Test your app locally

(Assuming you have completed all the prior sections and configurations in the blog):

python app.py
6. Check your Docker file and app.py starting point

Make sure your Docker file is updated as required based on the original that you cloned from the repo.

7. Check if the app.py is updated

It should have the following snippet in case you had it changed for our local tests. (The file from the repo should already have this):

if __name__ == '__main__':
    port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 8080))
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port, debug=False) 
    # NOTE: debug=False is crucial for production environments like Cloud Run
8. Deploy your app to Cloud Run

gcloud run deploy multi-db-app --source .

Select the region number (say 34 for us-central1) and allow unauthenticated option (“y”), when prompted.
